                    prefix tetra- (all of the game's pieces contain four segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport</p>

                <h2>Pac-Man: welcome to Arcade games!</h2>
                <p>PAC-MAN is an arcade game developed by Namco and first released in Japan in May 1980. It was created by Japanese
                    video game designer Toru Iwatani. It was licensed for distribution in the United States by Midway and
                    released in October 1980. Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is
                    considered one of the classics of the medium, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release,
                    the game—and, subsequently, Pac-Man derivatives—became a social phenomenon that yielded high sales of
                    merchandise and inspired a legacy in other media, such as the Pac-Man animated television series and
                    the top-ten hit single "Pac-Man Fever".[11] Pac-Man was popular in the 1980s and 1990s and is still played
                    in the 2010s.</p>
